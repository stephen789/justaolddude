Sin-gu-la-ri-ty (noun) - a distinctive feature, a uniqueness; a point at which
continuity breaks up; a point in history at which machine becomes smarter than 
humanity and/or fuses with it indivisively; or simply a cool sounding word with 
the initials S.G. in it :)
	
Singularity Viewer is a SecondLife(tm) protocol compatible client application.
It can be used to access SecondLife services as well as a number of others such
as those based upon the OpenSim platform.

Singularity is maintained by a small group of volunteers who can be contacted
both, in-world (SingularityViewer group) as well as on IRC (#SingularityViewer
@ FreeNode). Bug requests and features requests can be submitted through our
Issue Tracker (http://code.google.com/p/singularity-viewer/issues/list or from
the viewer menu: Help --> Bug Reporting --> Singularity Issue Tracker...)

History

The Singularity viewer was started by Siana Gearz in November 2010 by forking it
from the Ascent Viewer, by Balseraph Software Group, which in turn was based upon
source code modified from the snowglobe source code released by Linden Lab.
